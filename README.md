## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

As part of my development process, I utilize a dual-tabbed web browser window to compare my live environment with a provided image. By enabling web tools for both tabs and setting the mode to mobile development with a target mobile width, I am able to achieve a tracing paper-like experience for achieving near-perfect code-to-image matching. Once the mobile development is complete, I scale the live environment upwards to identify any breakpoints and address any issues that arise until the targeted desktop dimensions are achieved.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts
- Buttons have an Active State

### What I learned

I have gained valuable insight into the versatility of FlexBox, which allows for seamless switching of content flow direction between columns and rows based on the display port size.

### Continued development

In order to further develop this project, I would consider utilizing a JavaScript framework such as Svelte or Astro. By doing so, I could break down the `<article />` elements into reusable components that would become static content at build time. Additionally, I would aim to standardize the CSS measurements, as opposed to using numerous exact decimal style measurements. This would enable more efficient calculations for the margin, border, and padding properties.
